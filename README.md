-SELECT first_name, LENGTH(first_name) AS name_length FROM employees;

-- 14. Convert hire_date to display only the year
-SELECT first_name, last_name, YEAR(hire_date) AS hire_year FROM employees;

-- 15. Minimum and maximum salary for each job title
-SELECT job_title, MIN(salary) AS min_salary, MAX(salary) AS max_salary FROM employees GROUP BY job_title;

-- 16. Employees and their department names
-SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name 
-FROM employees e
-JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

-- 17. Employees, job titles, and department locations
-SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, j.job_title, l.city 
-FROM employees e
-JOIN jobs j ON e.job_id = j.job_id
-JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
-JOIN locations l ON d.location_id = l.location_id;

-- 18. Department names with employee count
-SELECT d.department_name, COUNT(e.employee_id) AS employee_count 
-FROM departments d
-LEFT JOIN employees e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
-GROUP BY d.department_name;

-- 19. Employees with the same job as their manager
-SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name 
-FROM employees e
-JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id
-WHERE e.job_id = m.job_id;

-- 20. Employees who worked in different jobs in the past
-SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name 
-FROM employees e
-JOIN job_history jh ON e.employee_id = jh.employee_id
-GROUP BY e.first_name, e.last_name
-HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT jh.job_id) > 1;
